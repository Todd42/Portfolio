 # Scrambled
 
   This contains a sample of screenshots from a timed level based platformer project I have been working on in my spare time. The primary gimmick of this game is the scramble mechanic. When your player character takes a hit, he becomes disabled for about 1 second. After which the player will find that their movement controls have been randomized and must quickly retrain their fingers in order to complete the level in time to acheive the par time.
